# BroughLike

Following [BroughLike tutorial](https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/) but using the [Kha](https://github.com/kode/kha) framework instead.

Kha is an ultra-portable, high performance, open source multimedia framework. It use the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) toolkit, an open source project based on a modern, high level, strictly typed programming language, a cross-compiler, a complete cross-platform standard library and ways to access each platform's native capabilities.

Also, I used the [Raccoon Engine](https://github.com/lewislepton/raccoon) from Lewis Lepton to build a fast prototype. I invite you to watch his [Kha Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4neAtv21WOmmR5mKb7TQvEQHpMh1h0po) on Youtube.
